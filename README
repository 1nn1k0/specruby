This repository bundles the original release of specRuby and provides a small fix 
that prevented it from working with recent Ruby versions (to the interested: the 
original release generated code with a space before the opening parenthesis of an
argument list, which throws an error with recent Ruby interpreters - see changes).

The release that was used and modified has been retrieved from: 
	http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~rise/SpecTcl1.1-for-Ruby.tar.gz 

All original credits and licensing terms (see license.terms) apply.

For OS X users: specruby can be launched with:
	wish SpecTcl/main.tk -ruby
(provided you have a ruby with Tcl/Tk support installed)

#### Ruby Preface ####

specRuby was derived from specPerl by Conrad Schneiker, 2000-07-23,
with some helpful pointers from Mark Kvale (the one who did the
original specPerl work).  See README.perl2ruby for more information.

The real simple stuff pretty much works (see SpecTcl/untitled.ui and
SpecTcl/untitled.ui.rb), but since getting this working, I haven't had
time to check the rest of the stuff out. I've still got to fix up the
stuff for scrollbars. "#???" comments flag uncompleted stuff in
ruby_init.tk.

Following Mark's advice, I'm bundling up everything in one
distribution, so you don't have to fetch SpecTcl1.1 separately, now
that it is open source. I've also included perl_init.tk, and the
changes I've made to preferences.tk have hooks for Perl and Python in
addition to Ruby.

For some reason that I haven't tracked down, I had problems with
wish8.2 and wish8.3 dying with segmentation fault when run from the
standard specPerl or modified specRuby script. So I just used this ksh
alias for the time being:

    specruby='wish8.3 /<your_path>/SpecTcl1.1-for-ruby/SpecTcl/main.tk -ruby'

To enter Ruby commands in the property dialogs, follow this pattern:

    proc {print "The Ruby Button was pressed.\n"}

Welcome to release 1.1 of SpecTcl/SpecJava

This is a source release of Spectcl 1.1.  This will run as provided
under Windows 95, MacOS, various UNIX flavors, with Tcl 7.6 and Tk
4.2 or greater.

Under UNIX, if this distribution is unpacked into $SPECHOME, then the
DIR variable in the scripts "specJava" and "specTcl" in the bin
subdirectory of $SPECHOME need to be editted to point the
$SPECHOME. See comments in these two scripts for details.

Under Windows the installer puts an entry in the Startup menu for
SpecTcl.

Under Macintosh you simply need to run the provided installer.

See license.terms for the SpecTcl licensing terms.

See the file: "changes" for a list of changes made since the previous
release.

Information about SpecTcl and SpecJava is available at:
